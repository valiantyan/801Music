# Git Commit Format

## Context
- When making Git commits
- When managing Git workflow
- When ensuring version control history is clear and readable

## Requirements
- Commit messages must follow the format below
  ```
  {type}({scope}): {subject}
  <BLANK LINE>
  {body}
  ```
- Type must be a predefined valid type
- Scope is mandatory, must be in English, and should indicate the location of the change (file, component, or package)
- Subject line must be in Chinese, concisely describing the change
- Subject line must use present tense, imperative mood
- Subject line must not start with a capital letter or end with a period
- Subject line must not exceed 60 characters
- Message body must be in Chinese, detailing the motivation for the change and comparisons to previous behavior
- All lines must not exceed 80 characters in width

### Scope Determination Guidelines
  - Automatically determine from the modified file path, e.g., when modifying files under `core/log/`, the scope is `log`
  - When modifying multiple modules, use the name of the most significant module as the scope, such as `core`, `banner`, `interstitialAd`
  - For cross-module infrastructure changes, use `infra` or specific technology names like `build`, `ci`
  - If the change affects the entire project, use `global` or `project`
  - Always prioritize using existing module names as scope to maintain consistency

## Examples
<example>
✅ `feat(log): 新增日志工具类并优化 SDK 日志输出`

1. 引入 AdWeaveLogger 工具类，提供统一的日志管理
2. 在 AdWeaveSDK 中集成日志工具，增加调试模式控制
3. 优化 SDK 初始化、广告加载和展示上报的日志输出
</example>

<example type="invalid">
❌ `feat: 新增日志工具` (missing scope)

❌ `Updated logger and fixed some bugs` (completely fails to follow format requirements)

Correct format should be: `feat(logger): 新增日志工具`
</example>

## Critical Rules
  - Strictly follow the `{type}({scope}): {subject}` format, scope cannot be omitted
  - Common types: feat (new feature), fix (bug fix), docs (documentation), style (formatting), refactor (refactoring), test (testing)
  - Subject line must be in Chinese, concise and clear
  - Message body must be in Chinese, explaining the reasons for and impact of the changes in detail
  - Commit messages must use present tense and imperative mood
